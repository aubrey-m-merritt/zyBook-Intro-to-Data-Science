'''
Mad Libs are activities that have a person provide various words, which are then used to complete a short story in unexpected (and hopefully funny) ways.

Complete a program that reads four values from input and stores the values in variables first_name, whole_number, plural_noun, and generic_location. The program then uses the input values to output a short story. The first input statement is provided in the code as an example.

Notes: To test your program in the Develop mode, pre-enter four values (in separate lines) in the input box and click the Run program button. The auto-grader in the Submit mode will test your program with different sets input of values.

Ex: If the input values are:

Eric
12
cars
Chipotle
then the program uses the input values and outputs a story:

Eric buys 12 different types of cars at Chipotle
Ex: If the input values are:

Brenda
6
bells
Phillys
then the program uses the input values and outputs a story:

Brenda buys 6 different types of bells at Phillys

# Read a value from a user and store the value in first_name

# TODO: Type your code to read three more values here.


# Output a short story using the four input values. Do not modify the code below.
print(first_name, 'buys', whole_number, 'different types of', plural_noun, 'at', generic_location)
