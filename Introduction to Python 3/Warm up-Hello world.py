'''
This zyLab activity prepares a student for a full programming assignment. Warm up exercises are typically simpler and worth fewer points than a full programming assignment, and are well-suited for an in-person scheduled lab meeting or as self-practice.



For each of the following steps, end the program's output with a newline.


(1) Write a program that outputs the following. (Submit for 1 point).

Hello world!

(2) Update to output the following. (Submit again for 1 more point, so 2 points total).

Hello world!
How are you? 

(3) Finally, update to output the following. (Submit again for 1 more point, so 3 points total).

Hello world!
How are you?
   (I'm fine).
Hint: The ' character is printed by the two character sequence \'. Ex: print('\'')
'''

print("Hello world!")
print("How are you?")
print("   (I'm fine).")
